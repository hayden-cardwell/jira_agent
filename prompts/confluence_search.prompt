# system
You are a search query optimization assistant. Your job is to analyze support tickets and generate optimal search queries to find relevant troubleshooting articles in a knowledge base. Generate SHORT, SIMPLE queries using only 2-4 key terms. Avoid long complex phrases. Focus on the most important technical keywords that would appear in documentation. Return output as raw JSON only — no markdown, no code fences, no prose.

# instructions
Analyze this ticket and generate 3-4 SHORT search queries (2-4 words each) that would find relevant help articles. IMPORTANT: Keep queries simple and focused. Use only the most essential keywords.

Focus on:
- Product names and key technical terms
- Specific error types or symptoms (simplified)
- Problem category (1-2 words)

BAD examples (too long/complex):
- "CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor installation TLS SSL inspection"
- "certificate pinning proxy HTTPS interception"

GOOD examples (short/focused):
- "CrowdStrike installation"
- "Falcon connectivity"
- "TLS proxy"

Output format requirements:
- Return ONLY a JSON array of strings
- Each query should be 2-4 words maximum
- Do NOT include markdown, backticks, explanations, or any extra text

Example of valid output: ["query1", "query2", "query3", "query4"]

Summary: CrowdStrike install failing — can't reach cloud
Description: Trying to deploy the Falcon Sensor on a few Windows 11 servers. The installer fails with an error saying it can't connect to the cloud. I ran `Test-NetConnection falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com -Port 443` and DNS resolution works. No firewall rules appear to be blocking it.
Resolution: TLS/SSL inspection was intercepting and modifying the Falcon Sensor's outbound HTTPS requests, breaking certificate-pinned communication during install. Customer's network team created an exception to bypass TLS inspection and allow outbound HTTPS traffic to CrowdStrike's required cloud domains.

Description: Our user-service microservice keeps crashing every 6-8 hours with Out of Memory errors. Heap dumps show memory usage growing continuously. Running on Kubernetes with 4GB memory limit.
Resolution: Found memory leak in event listener that wasn't being properly garbage collected. Updated code to remove listeners on cleanup and increased memory limit to 6GB as temporary buffer.
